# A basic template to get started with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

    This project is a fork of the HTML5 Boilerplate.
    It has been simplified for those starting out with web development and programming.

<h2>How to use this template:</h2>
<ul>
  <li>1> Opening the template</li>
  <li>2> Using the template</li>
  <ul>
    <li><h4>HTML</h4></li>
       >> Start with index.html, this will be your root page (the main page)
    <li><h4>CSS</h4></li>
       >> Start with style.css inside the css folder
       >> What are bootstrap.min.css and owl.carousel.css for?
        They make basic icon styles consistent across all kinds of web browsers
    <li><h4>Java Script</h4></li>
       >> Start with main.js inside the js folder
    <li><h4>Images</h4></li>
       >> If you want to host your own images, put the image file (.jpg, .png, .gif) inside the images directory.
          Then the source on an img tag will be
                <img src="/images/your_picture.jpg">
  </ul>
  </ul>
