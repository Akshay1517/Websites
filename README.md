# A basic template to get started with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

    This project is a fork of the HTML5 Boilerplate.
    It has been simplified for those starting out with web development and programming.

How to use this template:

  1> Opening the template<br>
  2> Using the template
 
   HTML
       >> Start with index.html, this will be your root page (the main page)<br>
   CSS
       >> Start with style.css inside the css folder
       >> What are bootstrap.min.css and owl.carousel.css for?
        They make basic icon styles consistent across all kinds of web browsers<br>
    Java Script
       >> Start with main.js inside the js folder<br>
    Images
       >> If you want to host your own images, put the image file (.jpg, .png, .gif) inside the images directory.
          Then the source on an img tag will be
                &lt img src="/images/your_picture.jpg"  &gt
